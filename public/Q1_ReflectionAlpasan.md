# Q1 End of Quarter Reflections

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. Variable declaration is the way we create storage for data in JavaScript. We use var, let, or const to declare variables. This is important because it lets us save and use values later in the program.

2. JavaScript operations are actions we use to work with data. These include arithmetic operations like +, -, *, and /, as well as comparison operations like == and >. They help us calculate values and compare data in our code.

3. JavaScript statements are commands that tell the computer what to do. Examples include declaring variables, assigning values, or calling functions. They are the basic instructions that make up a program.

4. Control statements help us decide what the program should do under certain conditions. Examples are if, else if, and else. They let the program follow different paths depending on the situation.

5. Loop structures allow code to repeat multiple times. Common loops are for, while, and do...while. They are useful when we want to do the same task again and again, like going through a list of numbers.

## 2-3. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  

I feel that I am already familiar with the topics we discussed in the first quarter. Because of this, I do not have any topics that I need further practice or discussion on at the moment. I understand the lessons well and feel confident with what we have covered so far :3

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective:

1. One effective activity was the loop pair activity with right triangles. It helped me understand how loops worked by letting me see how the code repeated to form shapes. This made loops easier to understand because I saw how the logic applied step by step.

2. Another effective activity was not actually in class, but a bonus: creating a personal homepage! It helped me learn so much about designing and coding with HTML. This activity made me explore more on my own and apply what we learned in a creative way!

### Not Effective:

There were no activities that I found ineffective :P 

Everything we did in class was fun, engaging, and helped me learn more about computer science! These activities also made me appreciate the subject more and come to love it!
